# YT_Dynamic_Web_Fullscreen_Extension

Tired of YouTube’s default fullscreen or theater modes not fitting your workflow? YouTube Focus Frame gives you a smarter, cleaner viewing experience — perfectly fitted to your browser window.

🛠️ How It Works:
The extension injects a script into YouTube pages.

It finds the main video player and stretches it to cover the entire browser window (not your full screen).

It uses window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight every second to keep it perfectly fit.

Clicking the extension icon toggles between normal mode and focus mode.


## 🌟 Features

- 📏 Auto-resizes video to match your current browser window — no wasted space.
- 🧠 Smart tracking of your screen size: adjusts dynamically every second.
- ⛔ No scrollbars, no clutter — just clean, focused viewing.
- 🔄 Toggle on/off with a single click.
-🧩 Works directly in your browser without needing fullscreen permissions.
